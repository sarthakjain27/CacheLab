 * trans.c - Matrix transpose B = A^T
 *
 * Each transpose function must have a prototype of the form:
 * void trans(size_t M, size_t N, double A[N][M], double B[M][N], double *tmp);
 * A is the source matrix, B is the destination
 * tmp points to a region of memory able to hold TMPCOUNT (set to 256) doubles as temporaries
 *
 * A transpose function is evaluated by counting the number of misses
 * on a 2KB direct mapped cache with a block size of 64 bytes.
 *
 * Programming restrictions:
 *   No out-of-bounds references are allowed
 *   No alterations may be made to the source array A
 *   Data in tmp can be read or written
 *   This file cannot contain any local or global doubles or arrays of doubles
 *   You may not use unions, casting, global variables, or 
 *     other tricks to hide array data in other forms of local or global memory.
